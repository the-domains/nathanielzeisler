**About:** Nate Zeisler envisions a world where students majoring in the arts have a clear path to a sustainable career, where creative minds are empowered and inspired to rule the workforce, and where access to the arts is not just for the privileged few, but for all.

As the Director of Community Engagement and Career Development at the Colburn School in Los Angeles, Nate:

* Is building a pipeline of sequential arts learning for hundreds of children in greater Los Angeles so that children of all backgrounds may experience a performing arts education.
* Supports the careers of world-class artists and passionate entrepreneurs, offering career advice and action-based learning opportunities that prime them for the 21st century workforce.

When he's not passionately developing programs and careers at the Colburn School, you can find him checking out the SoCal tidal pools with his wife and two children, contributing to this blog, and (painfully) attempting to surf.
